# 👋 Knerup Pastor (he/him) 
I'm a Interactive Design & Technology **student** learning at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I am currently learning UX/UI. Though I am not the best at coding, I have very much enjoyed creating the webpages that we have made in class. I hope to become a future graphic designer and use what I know about coding to make really cool websites.
